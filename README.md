# üï∏Ô∏è `wireveil`

Wireveil is a firewall designed for A/D CTF competitions. It selectively blocks packets based on configurable regular expressions, providing a flexible and efficient way to enforce network security policies.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Regex-based Packet Filtering**: Define custom regex patterns to block specific packet contents.
- **Service-specific Rules**: Configure rules for individual services running on different ports.
- **NFQueue Integration**: Uses Linux's NFQueue for packet inspection and verdicts.
- **Logging and Tracing**: Provides detailed logs for blocked packets and system events.
- **Low-level NFT Setup**: Uses low level NFT FFI bindings for C to interact with `nftables` safely.
- **Multiple Instances**: Each Wireveil instance is separated by design, so you can run multiple without conflicts.

## üì¶Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZephyrCodesStuff/wireveil.git
   cd wireveil
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - Ensure you have Rust installed. If not, install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
   - Install the required libraries for `libnfnetlink` and `libnetfilter_queue`:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libnfnetlink-dev libnetfilter-queue-dev
     ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## üîß Configuration

WireVeil uses a `wireveil.toml` configuration file to define services and their respective rules. An example configuration file is provided as `wireveil.toml.example`.

### üç± Example Configuration

```toml
[services]

[services.vuln_http_service]
port = 8080
block = [
    "[A-Z0-9]{31}=",
    "flag{[a-zA-Z0-9]+}",
]

[services.vuln_tcp_service]
port = 3000
block = ["[A-Z0-9]{31}="]
```

- **port**: The port number the service listens on.
- **block**: A list of regex patterns to block packets matching these patterns.

Rename `wireveil.toml.example` to `wireveil.toml` and modify it as needed:
```bash
mv wireveil.toml.example wireveil.toml
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   sudo ./target/release/wireveil
   ```

2. The application will:
   - Load the configuration file.
   - Set up iptables rules to redirect packets to NFQueue.
   - Start processing packets based on the defined rules.

3. To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C`. The iptables rules will be cleaned up automatically.

### üî® Troubleshooting
> `iptables: Bad rule (does a matching rule exist in that chain?)`

Your system might not be running the `nftables` backend.

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy
sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è Logging

WireVeil uses the `tracing` crate for logging. You can configure the log level using the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. For example:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug sudo ./target/release/wireveil
```
